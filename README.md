This repository contains a comprehensive collection of assignments from the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, completed during the 3rd semester of my Computer Engineering studies at the National Technical University "Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute." The projects cover various fundamental concepts of programming in C#, ranging from basic data types and control structures to advanced object-oriented principles.

Key Areas Covered:
Console Applications: These tasks, including currency conversion and time calculation, focus on basic data manipulation, mathematical operations, and conditionals, laying a strong foundation for more complex programming challenges.

WinForms Applications: Projects like the currency converter and array element manipulation showcase my initial experience with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in C#, emphasizing the transition from console-based programs to interactive desktop applications.

Array and Loop Operations: Assignments such as cyclic array shifting and finding maximum/minimum values in arrays highlight my proficiency in handling data structures and loops, essential skills for efficient coding.

String Manipulation: Tasks involving word counting, reversing strings, and checking bracket placement demonstrate my ability to work with string data, a crucial aspect of many programming scenarios.

Object-Oriented Programming: Central to this repository, the assignments related to the Student class illustrate core OOP concepts like class creation, property management, method implementation, and exception handling. These projects not only showcase my understanding of OOP principles but also my ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.

Each project is organized by task and designed to progressively build a solid understanding of C# programming and object-oriented principles, providing a strong foundation for further software development studies and professional practice.

Task 01: Currency Converter
Create a WinForms (.NET) application to calculate the equivalent amount in dollars based on an entered amount in hryvnias and the current exchange rate from hryvnia to dollar. The user inputs the amount in hryvnias and the exchange rate, and the program outputs the converted amount in dollars.
Example: If the input is 100 UAH and the exchange rate is 38.1, the result will be $2.62.

Task 02: Seconds to Time Converter
Create a console application to convert an entered number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. The user inputs the total number of seconds, and the program calculates and outputs the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Example: If the input is 3602 seconds, the result will be 1 hour, 0 minutes, and 2 seconds.

Task 03: GUI-Based 2D Array Element Replacement
Create a GUI application to work with a 2D array of random numbers. The program should find and swap the maximum and minimum elements in the array. The background of these elements should be highlighted with a distinct color. Additionally, display the indices of these elements in a label.
